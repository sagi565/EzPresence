_Last updated: November 2025_

Welcome to **EZpresence** ("we", "us", "our").  
These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the EZpresence platform, website, and related services (collectively, the "Service").  
By accessing or using EZpresence, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use our Service.

## **1. About EZpresence**

EZpresence is an AI-powered social media management and creative platform designed to help creators, entrepreneurs, and brands manage and grow their presence on social media.  
Our platform enables users to:
- Connect multiple social media accounts (such as TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook),  
- Schedule, publish, and analyze performance metrics over time, and  
- Create and enhance content (focused on short-form videos) through our **Studio** environment.

The **EZpresence Studio** is a creative space focused on 9:16 video content (stories, reels, and shorts). It allows users to generate professional-quality videos using AI-driven tools and algorithms based on user intent.  
Studio features include content creation assistants, video enhancers known as **"Wizards"** (such as automatic captioning, AI voice-overs, AI avatars, and branded outros), and access to next-generation AI video experiences leveraging text-to-video models (e.g., Sora, Veo, and others).

EZpresence is owned and operated by **EZpresence**, a company operating under **Israeli law**.  
For any questions about these Terms, you may contact us at **contact@ezpresence.com**.

## **2. Eligibility and Account Responsibilities**

EZpresence is intended for use by businesses, creators, and professionals managing social media accounts.
By using the Service, you confirm that you are authorized to manage or represent a business, brand, or creator account on the connected platform.
Users must be at least 16 years old, or meet the minimum age of digital consent in their country, to use the Service.

If you suspect unauthorized access to your account, you must notify us immediately at **contact@ezpresence.com**.

## **3. Subscriptions and Billing**

EZpresence offers both free and paid plans.  
- **Free Tier:** Limited access to certain features to help users explore the platform.  
- **Subscription Plans:** Paid plans grant extended functionality, billed according to the selected plan at the time of purchase.

Payments are processed through secure third-party payment processors.  
You authorize EZpresence (and our payment partners) to charge your chosen payment method for applicable fees.  
All fees are non-refundable unless required by law.

---

## **4. Connecting Social Media Accounts**

EZpresence connects exclusively to Business, Creator, or Professional accounts via each platform's official APIs (such as TikTok for Developers, Meta for Developers, YouTube Data API, Instagram Graph API etc.).
When you connect an account, you authorize EZpresence to securely access and process data that the connected platform explicitly permits — for example, profile details, performance metrics, media uploads, and engagement statistics.
EZpresence only collects and stores information necessary to deliver its features, including analytics, scheduling, publishing, and creative tools (such as AI-generated captions, video enhancements, or automated post scheduling).
You can revoke data access at any time directly from the connected platform's settings (e.g., TikTok, YouTube, or Meta).
EZpresence never accesses private user data (such as messages, personal contacts, or non-public account details) and never shares or sells data to third parties.

---

## **5. Data Handling and Security**

We take your privacy and data security seriously.  
- Data retrieved via social media integrations is stored securely on enterprise-grade cloud infrastructure and used solely to support your analytics dashboards, content scheduling, and creative workflows.
- Video content you create within **Studio** or upload to EZpresence — including externally sourced media — is **stored in your account** so you can manage, enhance, schedule, publish, and view it in the **Content** section of the platform. You may delete this content at any time from within EZpresence; residual copies may remain in backups for a limited period consistent with our retention practices.
- We may retain certain aggregated data to improve system performance, insights, and AI models over time.  
- EZpresence does not share, sell, or disclose user data to external parties, advertisers, or data brokers.
- You can delete your content directly from the **Content** section by choosing **Delete**. Deletions are **soft-deleted** for a short retention period (to allow recovery) before being **permanently removed** from active systems.

For additional information on privacy and data usage, please refer to our **[Privacy Policy](https://www.ezpresence.com/privacy-policy)**.
